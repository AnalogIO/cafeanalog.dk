			<p>Dear you,</p>

			<p>Thank you for taking the time to show interest in our organization. We know how big a part Analog has come to play in the lives of ITU students and staff, and we’re very proud to have such a loyal and loving customer base.</p>

			<p>Back in 2010, when it all started Analog was only open for a few hours a week, the numbers of volunteers was not much more than ten and black coffee was not on the menu. In the dark corner of what is now the library was only a few coaches, some old worn and tired chairs and the kitchen was the size of a small group room. Yet in these sparse settings the Analog spirit as we know it grew; Serving quality coffee at student friendly prices.</p>

			<p>Analog has since grown a great deal. We are running a real café with opening hours from 8 - 16 five times a week (fridays until 13), more than 70 volunteers are now serving 18 different beverages. We have six times the space that we used to and we have filled it with both new and old furnitures to give it the Analog vibe and make it a great place to hang out, relax or study.</p>

			<p>But with a growing organization and customer base, we cannot uphold the same prices that made sense in the old setting.</p>

			<p>In 2010 and a few years forward, a black coffee was made from Merrild coffee bought in Netto, brewed on a simple <a href="http://bit.ly/2piXwi4">Mocca Master</a> that could make up to eight cups per brew and served in a white plastic cup resulting in 20 cl. of semi-fancy Joe. This cup was sold for 5 kr. pr. cup.</p>

			<p>Our black coffee today is brewed on Animo double brewers with a capacity of 30 cups per brew, the beans we use are from a carefully selected coffee supplier, the cups are now 35 cl. and have padding that functions as a thermocoat to keep the coffee warm and your fingers from burning. Moreover, we try our best to have it ready for our more than 170 customers who buy a black coffee each day.</p>

			<p>In other words; It is a completely different cup we serve today, and the price we charge can no longer match the product we sell.</p>

			<p>We know that doubling the price on a product that is purchased by so many may seem unfair, but we wish to keep Analog a thriving organization, but also give more back to the student initiatives that are also part of ITU. We are one of the main sponsors of the Student Activity Fund and we wish to contribute even more. Not only financially, but also by providing a space, where students can meet and hangout - to study or just to chill out. To do that, we need to have capacity to upgrade our interior, but also our equipment so we can keep up with our growing customer base. </p>

			<p>We hope that the above have given you an answer to why we a altering our prices. We are always happy to answer questions, so feel free to reach out to us on: analogen@cafeanalog.dk. </p>

			<p>To be transparent, we wish to show some tables, which represents our current expenses and what actually goes into our black coffee: </p>

			<p>12% Profit, which do not account for waste. Moreover as a volunteer in Analog you get free black coffee, so for each 6th cup we are selling our barista is drinking one. </p>

			<p>5% Payment, which covers payment fees to Mobilepay and the creditcard terminal. </p>

			<p>39% Coffee, which represents the amount of coffee which we pour in each cup. </p>

			<p>44% Cup, when our cups are not sponsored they account for almost half of our expenses when making a cup of joe. </p>
